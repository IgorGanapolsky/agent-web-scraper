#### Enterprise Outreach Template A: Problem-Aware Diagnostic (Dan Kennedy Method)
**Subject:** "Is your team spending weeks on competitive analysis that's outdated by the time it's done?"

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question about [Company]'s market intelligence process:

Are you struggling to answer board-level questions about market shifts fast enough?

Most Series A CEOs I talk to face the same challenge:
â†’ Competitive analysis takes 3-6 weeks
â†’ Results are outdated by launch date  
â†’ Board wants real-time insights, not historical reports
â†’ McKinsey charges $200K+ for what becomes stale intelligence

I'd like to offer you a complimentary "Competitive Insight Diagnostic" call.

In 15 minutes, I'll analyze your specific market using our AI system and solve one real competitive intelligence challenge you're facing right now - live on the call.

No pitch, just results. Worth exploring?

Best,
Igor
```

#### Enterprise Outreach Template B: Board Pressure Pain Point
**Subject:** "[Name], how do you handle board questions about competitive threats between meetings?"

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

This scenario probably sounds familiar:

You're in a board meeting. Someone asks: "What's our biggest competitive threat in the next 6 months?"

You promise to "get back to them" and then spend $50K+ on a consulting project that takes 12 weeks.

By the time you have answers, the competitive landscape has shifted again.

I'd like to show you how [Similar Company] CEO solved this exact problem:

Now when board members ask competitive questions, he pulls up real-time intelligence in 30 seconds. 

Live data. Current threats. Immediate insights.

Want to see this in action during a 15-minute "Competitive Insight Diagnostic"?

I'll analyze your actual competitive landscape - live on the call.

Best,
Igor
```

#### Enterprise Outreach Template C: Missed Opportunity Fear (High-Value Lead Magnet)
**Subject:** "[Company] competitors just captured the $34M [specific niche] opportunity - did you see it coming?"

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

Your competitor [Specific Competitor] just announced expansion into [specific market niche].

Market size: $34M annually
Our AI flagged this opportunity 3 months ago.
