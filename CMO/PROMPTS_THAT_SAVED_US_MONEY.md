## 🎯 **EFFICIENCY PATTERNS THAT WORK**

### **The "Context Sandwich" Method**
```
[What you're building] + [Specific issue] + [What you've tried] + [Expected outcome]
```

**Example:**
"Building user authentication system + Login fails with 'invalid token' error + Tried refreshing tokens and checking expiration + Users should stay logged in for 24 hours"

### **The "Constraint Definition" Approach**
```
[Task] + [Technical constraints] + [Business requirements] + [Success criteria]
```

**Example:**
"Create database schema + MySQL 8.0, max 1GB storage + Handle 10K users + Sub-200ms query performance"

### **The "Batch and Specify" Strategy**
```
[Multiple related tasks] + [Detailed requirements for each] + [Consistent format request]
```

**Example:**
"Create 3 email templates: Welcome (warm, 100 words), Payment failure (urgent, solution-focused), and Renewal reminder (friendly, value-driven). All should include personalization and CTA buttons."

## 💡 **EFFICIENCY INNOVATIONS**

### **New This Week:**

#### **The "Error First" Protocol**
Instead of asking "Why isn't this working?", lead with:
```
"Error analysis needed: [exact error message] + [when it occurs] + [expected behavior] + [relevant code snippet]"
```
**Result:** 60% faster resolution, 40% fewer follow-up queries

#### **The "Template Request" Format**
For repetitive tasks, create reusable prompt templates:
```
"[TASK TYPE]: [Specific requirements] + [Format preferences] + [Constraints] + [Success metrics]"
```
**Result:** 50% consistency improvement, 30% time savings

#### **The "Reference Example" Method**
Include examples of desired output:
```
"Create X similar to this example: [paste example] but adapted for [specific use case] with [modifications]"
```
**Result:** 70% accuracy improvement, 45% fewer revisions

## 🚨 **COMMON CREDIT WASTERS TO AVOID**

### **❌ The Vague Villain**
"Make this better" - Costs 3-5 follow-up queries
**✅ Fix:** "Improve this code for readability: Add comments, extract complex logic into functions, use consistent naming"

### **❌ The Assumption Trap**  
"You know what I mean" - AI doesn't, leads to wrong output
**✅ Fix:** "Specifically, I need X to do Y when Z happens"

### **❌ The Feature Creep**
Starting simple, then adding requirements in follow-ups
**✅ Fix:** Define all requirements upfront in one comprehensive prompt

### **❌ The Context Skipper**
Asking for help without explaining the bigger picture
**✅ Fix:** "Building X for Y users who need Z functionality"
