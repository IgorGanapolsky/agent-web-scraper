# 💰 THE COST-SAVING PROTOCOL
## Our New Way of Working Smart, Not Hard

---

### 🎯 **THE MISSION**
Transform from credit firehose to credit sprinkler. Every query counts. Every dollar saved gets us closer to $300/day profit.

---

## 🚀 **THE PROTOCOL: THINK BEFORE YOU PROMPT**

### ⚡ **BEFORE EVERY QUERY - ASK:**
1. **Can I solve this without AI?** (Check docs, search codebase first)
2. **Is this the most specific prompt possible?** (Vague = expensive)
3. **Will this save more money than it costs?** (ROI mindset)
4. **Can I batch multiple questions together?** (1 query vs 5 queries)

### 🎪 **THE 4-STEP EFFICIENCY FRAMEWORK**

#### 1️⃣ **RESEARCH FIRST** (0 credits)
- Check existing documentation
- Search GitHub issues/discussions  
- Review previous solutions
- Google the error message

#### 2️⃣ **BE LASER SPECIFIC** (Save 70% credits)
❌ **Expensive:** "Help me with this code"  
✅ **Efficient:** "Fix this React useState hook error on line 42: 'Cannot read property of undefined'"

❌ **Expensive:** "Make this better"  
✅ **Efficient:** "Optimize this function for performance: reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n)"

#### 3️⃣ **BATCH YOUR REQUESTS** (Save 60% credits)
❌ **Expensive:** 5 separate queries for 5 functions  
✅ **Efficient:** "Review and optimize these 5 related functions for performance and readability"

❌ **Expensive:** Multiple debugging sessions  
✅ **Efficient:** "Debug these 3 related errors in my API endpoint"

#### 4️⃣ **CONTEXT IS KING** (Save 50% credits)
❌ **Expensive:** "This doesn't work"  
✅ **Efficient:** "This Express.js route returns 500 error when POST request includes nested JSON. Here's the code [paste], error log [paste], and expected behavior [describe]"

## 🧠 **EFFICIENCY MINDSET SHIFTS**

### **OLD WAY:**
> "I'll just ask AI to figure it out"

### **NEW WAY:**
> "Let me research this first, then ask AI one specific, well-crafted question"

### **OLD WAY:**
> "Generate some code for this feature"

### **NEW WAY:**
> "Here's my specific use case, constraints, and requirements. Generate optimized code that follows our existing patterns"

### **OLD WAY:**
> "Debug this for me"

### **NEW WAY:**  
> "I've isolated the issue to these 3 lines. The error is X, I expect Y. Here's what I've tried. Please provide the fix."
