# Web Scraping Solution Selection

- **Status**: accepted
- **Date**: 2025-05-17
- **Amends**: [Initial decision to use Playwright]

## Context and Problem Statement

We needed to implement a web scraping solution capable of handling modern JavaScript-heavy websites that use client-side rendering and may have anti-bot measures in place. The solution needed to be reliable, maintainable, and capable of handling concurrent requests efficiently.

## Decision Drivers

* **JavaScript Support**: Must execute and wait for JavaScript to render content
* **Anti-Bot Measures**: Must effectively bypass bot detection techniques
* **Performance**: Needs to handle concurrent requests efficiently
* **Maintainability**: Well-documented with active community support
* **Testing**: Should support headless execution for CI/CD pipelines

## Decision

After evaluating several options, we chose **undetected_chromedriver** with Selenium as our primary web scraping solution.

### Rationale

1. **Anti-Detection Capabilities**:
   - Specifically designed to avoid detection by anti-bot systems
   - Modifies ChromeDriver to remove automation flags
   - Handles common bot detection patterns

2. **Technical Advantages**:
   - Built on top of Selenium's mature ecosystem
   - Supports modern JavaScript-heavy websites
   - Automatic ChromeDriver management
   - Good balance of features and performance

3. **Maintenance & Support**:
   - Actively maintained open-source project
   - Large community around Selenium
   - Regular updates to handle new detection methods

4. **Integration**:
   - Works well with our existing Python stack
   - Compatible with standard Selenium patterns
   - Easy to extend and customize

### Trade-offs

* **Dependency on Chrome/Chromium**: Requires Chrome/Chromium to be installed
* **Resource Usage**: Higher memory usage than simple HTTP clients
* **Complexity**: More complex setup than basic HTTP clients
* **Update Frequency**: May require updates when Chrome updates break compatibility

## Alternatives Considered

### Playwright
- **Pros**: Modern API, good performance, built by Microsoft
- **Cons**: Less effective against bot detection, larger dependency footprint

### Pure Selenium
- **Pros**: Mature, widely used, many language bindings
- **Cons**: Easily detected by anti-bot measures, requires additional configuration

### Scrapy + Splash
- **Pros**: Good for large-scale scraping, built-in concurrency
- **Cons**: Additional complexity, Splash maintenance concerns, detection issues

### Pure requests + BeautifulSoup
- **Pros**: Lightweight, simple to implement for basic sites
- **Cons**: Cannot handle JavaScript rendering, easily blocked

### Scrapy + Splash
- **Pros**: Powerful for large-scale scraping, good for static content
- **Cons**: More complex setup, Splash maintenance concerns

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Reliable scraping of modern websites, good developer experience
- **Negative**: Larger deployment size, requires Docker or system dependencies
- **Neutral**: Steeper learning curve for developers new to browser automation

* Good, because mature and widely used
* Good, because multiple language bindings
* Bad, because slower than Playwright
* Bad, because more complex setup for async operations

### Scrapy + Splash

* Good, because good for large-scale scraping
* Bad, because Splash is not as well-maintained
* Bad, because more complex setup

### Pure requests + BeautifulSoup

* Good, because lightweight
* Bad, because cannot handle JavaScript
* Bad, because easily blocked by anti-bot measures
