# RAG Implementation Plan with ChromaDB
## 2-Hour Spike: Storing Successful Scrape Plans as Examples

### Overview
This spike explores implementing a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using ChromaDB to store and retrieve successful web scraping plans as examples for future scraping tasks.

### Architecture Design

#### 1. ChromaDB Setup
```python
# Core components needed:
- chromadb: Vector database for storing scrape plan embeddings
- sentence-transformers: For creating embeddings of scrape plans
- langchain: For RAG pipeline orchestration
```

#### 2. Data Structure for Scrape Plans
```json
{
  "plan_id": "uuid4",
  "website_domain": "reddit.com",
  "scraping_strategy": "API + HTML parsing",
  "selectors": ["css_selector_1", "xpath_2"],
  "success_metrics": {
    "posts_extracted": 150,
    "success_rate": 0.95,
    "execution_time": 45.2
  },
  "plan_description": "Successful Reddit pain point extraction using PRAW API...",
  "created_at": "2025-01-07T19:30:00Z",
  "tags": ["reddit", "api", "pain_points", "saas"]
}
```

#### 3. Implementation Components

##### A. Vector Store Manager
```python
class ScrapePlanVectorStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = chromadb.Client()
        self.collection = self.client.create_collection(
            name="scrape_plans",
            metadata={"description": "Successful web scraping strategies"}
        )

    def add_successful_plan(self, plan_data):
        # Convert plan to embedding and store
        pass

    def find_similar_plans(self, query, top_k=5):
        # Retrieve similar scraping strategies
        pass
```

##### B. Plan Extraction from Existing Jobs
```python
class ScrapePlanExtractor:
    def extract_from_successful_job(self, job_result):
        # Analyze successful Celery job results
        # Extract reusable patterns and strategies
        pass

    def generate_plan_description(self, extraction_data):
        # Use LLM to create natural language description
        pass
```

##### C. RAG Query Interface
```python
class ScrapePlanRAG:
    def suggest_scraping_strategy(self, target_website, requirements):
        # Find similar past successes
        # Generate customized recommendation
        pass

    def improve_failing_strategy(self, failed_attempt, error_logs):
        # Find alternative approaches from knowledge base
        pass
```

#### 4. Integration Points

##### With Existing Celery Tasks
- Hook into successful task completion
- Extract and store effective strategies automatically
- Build knowledge base organically over time

##### With Jobs API
- New endpoint: `/jobs/suggest-strategy`
- Returns recommended approach based on RAG lookup
- Provides confidence scores and similar examples

##### With Dashboard
- "Suggested Strategies" section
- Show similar past successes for new jobs
- Learning analytics dashboard

#### 5. Implementation Timeline (2 hours)

##### Hour 1: Core Setup
- [ ] ChromaDB installation and basic configuration
- [ ] Define scrape plan schema
- [ ] Create basic vector store operations
- [ ] Test embedding generation for sample plans

##### Hour 2: RAG Pipeline
- [ ] Implement similarity search
- [ ] Create plan suggestion logic
- [ ] Build basic query interface
- [ ] Test with existing job data

#### 6. Success Metrics

##### Technical
- Vector similarity search < 100ms response time
- Successful embedding of 50+ sample scrape plans
- RAG retrieval accuracy > 80% for similar domains

##### Business
- Reduce new scraping job setup time by 50%
- Increase first-attempt success rate for new websites
- Build reusable knowledge base for scaling operations

#### 7. Future Enhancements (Post-Spike)

##### Advanced Features
- Multi-modal embeddings (code + text + metadata)
- Automated strategy optimization based on success patterns
- Integration with web scraping best practices database

##### Scaling Considerations
- Distributed ChromaDB for high-volume operations
- Real-time strategy adaptation based on website changes
- A/B testing framework for strategy effectiveness

#### 8. Risk Mitigation

##### Technical Risks
- ChromaDB performance with large collections
- Embedding quality for technical scraping strategies
- Integration complexity with existing Celery infrastructure

##### Business Risks
- Over-reliance on past patterns for new challenges
- Strategy recommendations becoming outdated
- Maintenance overhead for knowledge base curation

### Conclusion
This RAG implementation provides a solid foundation for capturing and reusing successful web scraping knowledge. The 2-hour spike will validate core concepts and provide a clear path for full implementation.

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete 2-hour spike implementation
2. Evaluate results and refine approach
3. Plan full integration with existing job system
4. Scale knowledge base with production data
