Go to: https://github.com/users/IgorGanapolsky/projects/2/settings

Click "Workflows" and enable these rules:

1. **Auto-add items**:
   - When: Issue is created with label "high-priority"
   - Then: Add to project and set status to "Todo"

2. **Auto-add items**:
   - When: Issue is created with label "medium-priority"
   - Then: Add to project and set status to "In Progress"

3. **Auto-add items**:
   - When: Issue is created with label "low-priority"
   - Then: Add to project and set status to "Backlog"

4. **Auto-move items**:
   - When: Issue is assigned
   - Then: Set status to "In Progress"

5. **Auto-move items**:
   - When: Issue is closed
   - Then: Set status to "Done"

## ✅ AFTER SETUP:
- All future issues will auto-organize by priority
- Daily automation runs at 10 AM UTC
