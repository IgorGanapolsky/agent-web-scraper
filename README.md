# AI Business Kanban Dashboard

Welcome to the AI-Powered Market Research Agent's dashboard.

This directory contains the visual and data artifacts that reflect the current operational status and roadmap of the agent.

## Visual Dashboard Links

- 📊 [Visual Kanban Board](../project-dashboard/dashboard.html)  
  → Displays the real-time status of all pipeline, automation, and business outcome stages using `kanban.json`.

- 🗺️ [Roadmap PNG Snapshot](ai-business-roadmap.png)  
  → A visual high-level diagram of the business system generated by `update_diagram.py`.

## Data Sources

- `kanban.json`: The machine-readable status map of all system components.
- `metrics-daily.csv`: Historical logs of lead, revenue, and task-based metrics updated daily.
- `update_diagram.py`: Script that converts `kanban.json` into a diagram and pushes it.

## Setup Instructions

If you're setting this up locally or on CI:
1. Ensure your `kanban.json` is valid and present in `/project-dashboard/`.
2. Run `update_diagram.py` daily or via GitHub Actions.
3. Optional: Auto-commit `ai-business-roadmap.png` and `metrics-daily.csv` to reflect daily activity.
