# 🚀 Dagger CI/CD Pipeline

**Programmable deployment automation protecting $300/day revenue**

## Overview

Our Dagger.io implementation provides **code-as-infrastructure** CI/CD pipelines that ensure reliable deployments while protecting revenue-critical systems. Unlike traditional YAML-based CI/CD, Dagger lets us write deployment logic in Python with full programming capabilities.

## Why Dagger for Revenue-Critical SaaS

### 🎯 **Business Benefits**
- **Revenue Protection**: Automated validation before deployment
- **Faster Deployments**: <8 minutes for full pipeline
- **Consistent Environments**: Same pipeline runs locally and in CI
- **Reduced Downtime**: Comprehensive testing prevents production issues

### 🔧 **Technical Advantages**
- **Programmable**: Real Python code instead of YAML
- **Portable**: Run anywhere (local, GitHub Actions, GitLab, etc.)
- **Container-based**: Reproducible builds and tests
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at development time

## Pipeline Architecture

### Core Components

```python
@object_type
class SaaSPipeline:
    """Main pipeline for SaaS Market Intelligence Platform"""

    @function
    async def test_suite(self) -> str:
        """Run comprehensive test suite"""

    @function
    async def test_stripe_integration(self) -> str:
        """Test payment flows for revenue generation"""

    @function
    async def test_rag_engine(self) -> str:
        """Test agentic RAG system"""

    @function
    async def verify_revenue_metrics(self) -> str:
        """Verify $300/day tracking system"""

    @function
    async def full_ci_pipeline(self) -> str:
        """Complete CI/CD workflow"""
```

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Health Check Stage
```bash
dagger call quick-health-check
```
**Purpose**: Verify all systems are operational before running tests
**Duration**: <30 seconds
**Validates**:

- Revenue tracking ready

### 2. Test Suite Stage
```bash
dagger call test-suite
```
**Purpose**: Run comprehensive unit and integration tests
**Duration**: <2 minutes

### 3. Revenue System Validation
```bash
# Test payment flows
dagger call test-stripe-integration

# Test AI systems
dagger call test-rag-engine

# Verify metrics
dagger call verify-revenue-metrics
```
**Purpose**: Validate business-critical revenue systems
**Duration**: <3 minutes total

### 4. Production Build
```bash
dagger call build-production-image
```
**Purpose**: Create optimized Docker container for deployment
**Features**:
- Multi-stage builds for size optimization
- Security scanning
- Performance optimization
- Environment-specific configuration

### 5. Deployment Stage
```bash
dagger call deploy-to-staging
```
**Purpose**: Automated deployment with health verification
**Process**:
- Deploy to staging environment
- Run smoke tests
- Verify health endpoints
- Update load balancer

## Local Development Workflow

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Health check
dagger call quick-health-check

# Run specific tests
dagger call test-stripe-integration
dagger call test-rag-engine

# Full pipeline
dagger call full-ci-pipeline
```

### Development Testing
```bash
# Test individual components
python dagger/main.py test      # Full test suite
python dagger/main.py stripe    # Stripe integration
python dagger/main.py rag       # RAG engine
python dagger/main.py health    # Health check
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

### Automated Triggers
```yaml
# .github/workflows/dagger-ci.yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]      # Full CI/CD pipeline
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]      # Test suite only
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'     # Daily health checks
```

### Pipeline Execution
```yaml
steps:
  - name: "🏥 Quick Health Check"
    run: dagger call quick-health-check

  - name: "🧪 Run Test Suite"
    run: dagger call test-suite

  - name: "💳 Test Stripe Integration"
    run: dagger call test-stripe-integration

  - name: "🎯 Full CI Pipeline"
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    run: dagger call full-ci-pipeline
```
