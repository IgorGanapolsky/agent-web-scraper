# MSA Review Summary - Fission Labs Agreement
**Date**: July 3, 2025  
**Parties**: Fission Labs, Inc. & MAX Smith KDP LLC  
**Reviewer**: Igor Ganapolsky  

## Executive Summary
This document summarizes the Master Services Agreement review and key clarifications needed before signing.

## MSA Key Terms
- **Effective Date**: Upon signing by both parties
- **Services**: Per Statement of Work (SOW) - not yet provided
- **Duration**: Ongoing until terminated
- **Termination**: 2 months notice without cause
- **Payment Terms**: Monthly advance invoicing, 30-day terms, 1% late fees
- **IP Ownership**: Client owns deliverables upon full payment
- **Non-solicitation**: 2 years for employees

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Statement of Work (SOW)
The MSA references SOW throughout but none is attached. Without SOW:
- No guarantee of $0 development cost
- No specific deliverables defined
- No timeline commitments
- No technical approach specified

### 2. Payment Terms Concerns
- Section 5.3: "Invoices raised at beginning of month in advance"
- Section 5.4: "1% monthly interest on late payments"
- Without SOW confirming $0 development, unexpected invoices possible

### 3. Technical Approach Mismatch
- **Current Platform**: FastAPI/Python (35% complete, $28K+ value)
- **Their Proposal**: AWS Lambda serverless (starting fresh)
- Risk of discarding existing valuable codebase

### 4. Timeline vs Revenue Needs
- Their timeline: 125 days (17+ weeks)
- Revenue needed: ASAP due to $0 development budget
- Break-even possible: Month 2 with right priorities

## Financial Analysis

### Development Costs
- **Fission Labs Quote**: $39,199
- **Cost to Client**: $0 (strategic partnership)
- **Existing Code Value**: $28K+ already built

### Operating Costs & Break-Even
- **Monthly Operating**: $300-1,200 (scales with usage)
- **Initial Investment**: $300-1,000 (first 1-2 months only)
- **Break-Even**: Month 2 (weeks 5-6)
- **Month 3 Profit**: $8,000+ after all costs
- **Gross Margin**: 69%

### Revenue Projections
| Month | Revenue | Operating Costs | Net Profit |
|-------|---------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | $790 | $300-500 | -$210 to -$410 |
| 2 | $4,320 | $400-600 | +$3,120 to +$3,720 |
| 3 | $9,660 | $600-800 | +$8,460 to +$9,060 |
| 6 | $15,490 | $1,000-1,200 | +$14,290 to +$14,990 |

## Recommendations Before Signing

### 1. Request Statement of Work Including:
- Explicit "$0 development cost" statement
- Commitment to build on existing FastAPI platform (35% complete)
- Revenue-generating features prioritized:
  - Payment processing (Stripe integration)
  - User registration system
  - Production deployment
  - Customer dashboard
- Clear timeline with revenue milestones
- No invoices during development phase

### 2. Clarify MSA Sections:
- Amendment that Section 5 (Fees) doesn't apply to development
- Confirmation that only operating costs are client responsibility
- Operating costs begin only after revenue generation

### 3. Technical Alignment:
- Use existing FastAPI/Python codebase (35% complete)
- Focus on missing 65% for revenue generation
- Avoid restarting with AWS Lambda architecture

## Suggested Response to Fission Labs

"Thank you for the MSA. Before signing, I need:

1. Statement of Work (SOW) that includes:
   - Explicit confirmation of $0 development cost
   - Commitment to build on our existing FastAPI platform (35% complete)
   - Priority on revenue-generating features (payment, registration, production)
   - Timeline aligned with achieving $300/day revenue target

2. Clarification on payment terms:
   - Confirmation that no invoices will be sent during development
   - Client only responsible for operating costs after revenue starts
   - Operating costs estimated at $300-1,200/month

3. Technical approach confirmation:
   - Leverage our existing $28K+ of completed development
   - Focus on the critical gaps preventing revenue
   - Not restart with different architecture

Our existing platform is 35% complete with core AI functionality working. The focus should be on the missing 65% that enables customer acquisition and payment processing. This approach will achieve revenue goals faster than starting fresh.

I'm excited about this partnership and look forward to reviewing the SOW."

## Conclusion
**DO NOT SIGN** the MSA without:
1. Statement of Work (SOW)
2. Written confirmation of $0 development cost
3. Agreement to build on existing platform
4. Clarification that no development invoices will be sent

The partnership has strong potential with 69% gross margins and Month 2 break-even, but these critical items must be documented before proceeding.
