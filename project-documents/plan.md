| Claude API Success Rate | ≥98% | With retry logic and error handling |
| Weekly Email Volume | Up to 5,000 | Starting with SES sandbox limits |
| End-to-End Automation | Completed weekly flow | Reddit → Claude → SES |
| Email Delivery Rate | 95%+ | Including bounce handling |

## Implementation Timeline

| Milestone | Description | Duration (days) |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| M1 | Reddit Lambda Setup | 5 |
| M2 | ETL Pipeline | 10 |
| M3 | Embedding & Indexing | 8 |
| M3.5 | LLM Experimentation with FloTorch | 8 |
| M4 | Insight Engine | 8 |
| M5 | Weekly Email Delivery | 6 |
| M6 | Stripe Trial & Plan Management | 5 |
| M7 | Landing Page (React) | 3 |
| M8 | Monitoring & Logging | 2 |
| M9 | Infrastructure as Code | 5 |

**Total Timeline**: ~60 working days (125 person-days with parallel work)

## Cost Structure

### Development Cost
- **FissionLabs Quote**: $39,199
- **Actual Cost to Client**: $0 (provided free as consulting showcase)

### Estimated Monthly Operating Costs
- **AWS Lambda**: $50-200
- **AWS Bedrock (Claude)**: $100-500
- **Amazon S3**: $5-10
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: $10-25
- **Amazon SES**: $5-50
- **Amazon OpenSearch**: $100-300
- **Other AWS Services**: $20-50
- **Stripe Fees**: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction

**Total Monthly Estimate**: $300-1,200 (varies by usage)

### Cost Scaling Examples
- **Starting (100-500 users)**: ~$300-500/month
- **Growth (1,000-2,500 users)**: ~$600-800/month
- **Scale (5,000+ users)**: ~$1,000-1,200/month

### Important Cost & Break-Even Analysis
1. **Development Cost**: $0 (provided free by Fission Labs per MSA)
2. **Monthly Operating Costs**: $300-1,200 (scales with usage)
3. **Break-Even Timeline**: Month 2 (weeks 5-6 of operation)
4. **Initial Investment Needed**: $300-1,000 for first 1-2 months only
5. **Gross Margin**: 69% - highly profitable SaaS model
6. **Month 3 Projection**: $8,000+ monthly profit after all costs

### Cash Flow Timeline
- **Month 1**: -$210 to -$410 (small loss)
- **Month 2**: +$3,120 to +$3,720 (profitable)
- **Month 3**: +$8,460 to +$9,060 (strong profit)
- **Month 6**: +$14,290 to +$14,990 (scaling profit)

## Client Responsibilities
1. Provide AWS account with required permissions
2. Set up Stripe account and share credentials/webhooks
3. Verify domain and sender email ID in SES
4. Specify target subreddits and data sources
5. Provide GitHub repository for code maintenance
6. Authorize web domains and SSL certificates
7. **Cover operating costs**: $300-1,000 for first 1-2 months until break-even

## Critical MSA Clarifications Needed
1. **Statement of Work (SOW)**: Required before signing MSA
2. **Confirm $0 development cost**: Explicitly stated in SOW
3. **Technical approach**: Build on existing FastAPI platform (35% complete)
4. **No invoices during development**: Only operating costs after launch
5. **Revenue-first priorities**: Payment processing, customer registration, production deployment

## Risk Mitigation
- Reddit rate limiting included in PoC
- CloudWatch alerts for API quota monitoring
- SES bounce handling with DLQs
- Extensible schema for future data sources
- FloTorch integration for LLM flexibility

## Future Enhancements (Post-PoC)
- Human-in-the-loop review via admin UI
- A/B prompt testing
- User feedback loops
- Content moderation
- Multi-language support
- Personalization features
- Additional data sources beyond Reddit

## Decision Summary
The proposal demonstrates:
- Well-architected serverless foundation
- Clear phased rollout with lean PoC scope
- Strong AWS native service alignment
- Thoughtful error handling and observability
- Exceptional value with free development

**Recommendation**: Proceed with sign-off. The proposal is comprehensive, addresses all technical requirements, and provides clear success metrics with realistic timelines.

## Next Steps
1. Sign proposal and return to FissionLabs
2. Set up required AWS and Stripe accounts
3. Schedule kickoff meeting
4. Begin M1 implementation
