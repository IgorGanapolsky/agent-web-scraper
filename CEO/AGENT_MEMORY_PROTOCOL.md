# AGENT MEMORY PROTOCOL - PERMANENT REFERENCE SYSTEM
**Claude Squad Framework - Persistent Memory Integration**

## MEMORY ACCESS HIERARCHY

### PRIMARY MEMORY SOURCES (READ FIRST - ALWAYS)
1. **CLAUDE.md** - Core agent framework and current directives
2. **GitHub Issue #126** - Active Mission Control coordination
3. **MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md** - Strategic context and enterprise transformation
4. **AGENT_MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md** - This document (memory access instructions)

### MEMORY PERSISTENCE STRATEGY

**File-Based Permanent Memory:**
- All critical directives stored in version-controlled markdown files
- Git commits create permanent historical record
- Cross-referenced GitHub issues for active coordination

**Session Independence:**
- Each agent session begins with CLAUDE.md review
- Standing orders remain active across all conversations
- Progress tracking continues regardless of session breaks

---

## AGENT ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

### STARTUP SEQUENCE (EVERY SESSION)
```
1. Read CLAUDE.md → Current directives and standing orders
2. Check GitHub Issue #126 → Active Mission Control tasks
3. Review MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md → Strategic context
4. Execute role-specific standing orders
5. Report progress to CEO coordination system
```

### ROLE-SPECIFIC MEMORY CHECKPOINTS

**CTO Agent Startup:**
- [ ] Review technical infrastructure status
- [ ] Check GitHub CLI integration progress
- [ ] Validate enterprise platform deployment
- [ ] Report completion status to CEO

**CFO Agent Startup:**  
- [ ] Review financial model and revenue tracking
- [ ] Check Firebase SDK deployment status
- [ ] Validate cost optimization protocols
- [ ] Report completion status to CEO

**CMO Agent Startup:**
- [ ] Review customer acquisition campaign status
- [ ] Check Series A/B SaaS founder targeting progress
- [ ] Validate demo booking and conversion metrics
- [ ] Execute ongoing marketing initiatives

**Project Manager Startup:**
- [ ] Review overall project coordination status
- [ ] Check cross-team communication protocols
- [ ] Validate timeline adherence and progress tracking
- [ ] Coordinate agent reporting to CEO

## MISSION CONTROL MEMORY INTEGRATION

### CURRENT ACTIVE DIRECTIVES (PERMANENT)

**PRIMARY MISSION:** $300/day revenue target achievement
**COORDINATION:** GitHub Issue #126 for Mission Control implementation
**TIMELINE:** 48-hour implementation window for automated systems

**STANDING ORDERS (ALWAYS ACTIVE):**
- CTO: GitHub CLI integration + technical infrastructure
- CFO: Firebase SDK deployment + financial analytics
- CMO: Customer acquisition + revenue conversion
- PM: Cross-team coordination + progress tracking

### PROGRESS TRACKING MEMORY

**Completion Status Tracking:**
```
CTO_GITHUB_CLI: [PENDING] → Update when complete
CFO_FIREBASE_SDK: [PENDING] → Update when complete  
MISSION_CONTROL_SYSTEM: [IN_PROGRESS] → CEO oversight active
REVENUE_TARGET: [0/300] → Daily tracking toward $300/day
```

**Memory Update Protocol:**
1. Agents update progress in GitHub Issue #126
2. CEO reviews and updates CLAUDE.md with new directives
3. All agents reference updated memory in next session
4. Permanent record maintained in git history

---

## MEMORY PERSISTENCE VERIFICATION

### DAILY MEMORY CHECK
**All agents must verify:**
- [ ] CLAUDE.md read and current directives understood
- [ ] GitHub Issue #126 checked for active coordination
- [ ] Role-specific standing orders being executed
- [ ] Progress reported to CEO coordination system

### MEMORY INTEGRITY PROTOCOL
**File-based persistence ensures:**
- Directives survive session interruptions
- Progress tracking continues across conversations
- Strategic context maintained permanently
- Coordination never lost due to memory limitations

### ESCALATION FOR MEMORY CONFLICTS
**If memory sources conflict:**
1. CLAUDE.md takes precedence (CEO authority)
2. GitHub Issue #126 for active coordination updates
3. CEO resolution required for directive conflicts
4. Update all memory sources with resolved conflicts

---

## SUCCESS VERIFICATION

### MEMORY SYSTEM WORKING INDICATORS
- [ ] All agents reference CLAUDE.md at session start
- [ ] Progress updates posted to GitHub Issue #126
- [ ] Standing orders executed without re-instruction
- [ ] Mission Control coordination functioning smoothly

### FAILURE INDICATORS
- [ ] Agents don't reference permanent memory files
- [ ] Standing orders require re-explanation each session
- [ ] Progress tracking lost between conversations
- [ ] Coordination breaks down due to memory gaps
