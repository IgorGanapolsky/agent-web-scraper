# SaaS Growth Dispatch Architecture Overview

## AI Orchestration System Architecture

![SaaS Growth Dispatch Architecture](../docs/assets/architecture-2025.svg)

Our autonomous revenue system leverages a sophisticated multi-agent architecture where each AI specializes in distinct business functions, coordinated through n8n workflows to achieve our $300/day profit target.

## Core Components

### 1. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers

The backbone of our AI coordination system, providing secure, standardized communication between agents:

- **Stripe MCP Server**: Handles payment processing, subscription management, and revenue tracking
- **Dashboard MCP Server**: Real-time metrics aggregation and business intelligence
- **GitHub MCP Server**: Development workflow automation and issue management
- **Integration APIs**: Unified interface for external service coordination

```yaml
# MCP Server Configuration
stripe_server:
  pricing_tiers: [$8, $80, $240]
  trial_periods: [7, 14]
  integration: google_sheets, supabase

dashboard_server:
  metrics: [mrr, daily_revenue, conversion_rates]
  targets: {daily: $300, monthly: $9000}
  alerts: slack, github_issues
```

### 2. n8n Automation Flows

Five critical workflows orchestrate our entire business pipeline:

#### Workflow 1: Content Intelligence Pipeline
- **Trigger**: Daily 6AM EST
- **Process**: Reddit/GitHub scraping → Pain point extraction → Report generation
- **Output**: Daily intelligence reports delivered to subscribers

#### Workflow 2: Revenue Conversion Engine
- **Trigger**: New subscriber signup
- **Process**: Trial onboarding → Engagement tracking → Conversion optimization
- **Output**: Automated trial-to-paid conversion

#### Workflow 3: Meta Ad Campaign Automation
- **Trigger**: Weekly performance review
- **Process**: Audience analysis → Creative optimization → Budget allocation
- **Output**: Self-optimizing ad campaigns

#### Workflow 4: Substack Publication Pipeline
- **Trigger**: Content approval trigger
- **Process**: Post scheduling → Cross-platform distribution → Engagement tracking
- **Output**: Multi-channel content distribution

#### Workflow 5: Business Intelligence Dashboard
- **Trigger**: Real-time data updates
- **Process**: Metrics aggregation → Performance analysis → Strategic recommendations
- **Output**: Executive dashboard with actionable insights

### 3. Meta Ad Engine Integration

Autonomous advertising system targeting SaaS founders and growth teams:

- **Audience Targeting**: Lookalike audiences based on subscriber behavior
- **Creative Optimization**: A/B testing of ad creatives and copy
- **Budget Management**: Dynamic allocation based on ROAS performance
