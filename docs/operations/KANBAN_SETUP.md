```javascript
javascript:(function(){
const issues = [42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57];
alert('Add these issues to your project: #' + issues.join(', #'));
})();
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

After setup, your board should show:
- **Todo**: 7 high-priority issues
- **Backlog**: 5 medium-priority issues
